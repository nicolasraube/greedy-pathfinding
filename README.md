# Greedy-Pathfinding
Visualizing the greedy algorithm

![Program running, lots of connected nodes with the shortest found path highlighted](https://github.com/nicolasraube/greedy-pathfinding/blob/master/assets/example.jpg)

## How to run
- Install [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- run (double-click) the "GreedyPathfinding.jar" file from this repository

## Usage
1. Left-click anywhere on the grid to create a node, the first one will be your starting node (green).
The last node you create will be your end node (red).
2. Right-click on two nodes to connect them.
3. If you now click on start, the algorithm will follow the shortest edge until it has found your end node (red).
